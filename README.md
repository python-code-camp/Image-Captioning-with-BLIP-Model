Generate Descriptions Using Python!

Ever wondered how applications like Google-Photos can identify and describe what's in an image?.

That's the power of image-captioning!
Image-captioning is a process, where an AI model looks at an image, and generates a descriptive Sentence. 
This technology is used in various applications like:
